# Titanic Survival Prediction

## Overview

This project aims to predict the likelihood of survival for passengers on the Titanic using data science techniques in Python. The dataset is sourced from the famous Kaggle competition [Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).

## Usage

Follow the steps outlined in the notebook to execute the data transformation, train the random forest classifier, and perform grid search for hyperparameter tuning.

## Data Transformation

The dataset undergoes preprocessing and feature engineering to prepare it for the machine learning model. This includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

## Random Forest Classifier

A random forest classifier is used to build the predictive model. The classifier is trained on the transformed dataset to predict the survival outcome.

## Grid Search

Grid search is employed to find the optimal hyperparameters for the random forest classifier, enhancing the model's performance.

## Results

The final model's performance metrics and accuracy on the Titanic dataset are presented in the notebook.
